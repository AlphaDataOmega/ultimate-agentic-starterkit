# StarterKit Development Context

## Project Status & Context

### Current State
- **Phase 1 & 2**: âœ… Complete - All missing agents implemented and integrated
- **Phase 3**: âœ… Complete - AI-driven workflow integration implemented
- **Phase 4**: ðŸš€ Planning - Advanced AI automation features identified
- **Test Case**: Pong game OVERVIEW.md ready for validation

### Core Achievement
The StarterKit has successfully transformed from a static template-based system to an intelligent AI-driven agentic workflow. The system now implements incremental work order creation, interactive learning, and project-type-aware documentation generation through AI analysis rather than hardcoded templates.

## AI-Driven Agentic Workflow

### Complete Workflow (IMPLEMENTED)
```
1. User creates OVERVIEW.md
2. kit.py --workflow OVERVIEW.md triggers complete workflow
3. Enhanced Project Manager generates AI-driven clarifying questions
4. User answers questions interactively via CLI
5. System refines project scope using AI analysis
6. System detects project type via AI (GAME, WEB_APP, CLI_TOOL, etc.)
7. System creates appropriate /docs files using AI generation
8. System creates SINGLE work order #1 via AI analysis
9. Claude Code Agent implements work order #1
10. Testing/Validation Agent validates implementation
11. If pass â†’ Documentation Agent updates docs using AI
12. If fail â†’ Retry logic up to 5 times â†’ BugBounty Agent
13. System analyzes completion via AI and creates NEXT work order
14. Repeat steps 8-13 until project complete
```

### AI Enhancement Points
- **Interactive Learning**: AI generates project-type-specific questions
- **Project Type Detection**: AI analyzes overview content to determine project type
- **Document Generation**: AI creates appropriate docs based on project complexity
- **Work Order Creation**: AI determines optimal work order sequence
- **Completion Analysis**: AI analyzes results to plan next work order
- **Error Recovery**: AI analyzes failures and suggests recovery strategies

## Phase 3 Implementation (COMPLETED)

### 1. Interactive Learning Phase âœ…

**Location**: `agents/enhanced_project_manager.py`

**Implemented Solution**:
```python
async def _generate_clarifying_questions(self, overview_content: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Generate project-specific clarifying questions using AI analysis"""
    
async def _present_questions_to_user(self, questions: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Present questions via CLI and capture user responses"""
    
async def _refine_project_scope(self, overview_content: str, responses: Dict) -> str:
    """Update project scope based on user responses using AI"""
```

**Key Implementation Details**:
- AI-driven question generation based on project type detection
- Interactive CLI interface for user responses
- Project scope refinement using AI analysis of user answers
- Integration with StarterKitOrchestrator for workflow management

**kit.py Integration**:
```python
# kit.py should handle the interactive flow
def run_interactive_planning(overview_path: str):
    # 1. Load OVERVIEW.md
    # 2. Generate questions
    # 3. Present to user via CLI
    # 4. Capture responses
    # 5. Update project context
    # 6. Proceed to work order creation
```

### 2. Project Type Awareness âœ…

**Location**: `core/knowledge_base.py`

**Implemented Solution**:
```python
class ProjectType(str, Enum):
    GAME = "game"
    WEB_APP = "web_app"
    CLI_TOOL = "cli_tool"
    API_SERVICE = "api_service"
    MOBILE_APP = "mobile_app"

async def detect_project_type(self, overview_content: str) -> ProjectType:
    """Detect project type from overview content using AI analysis"""

async def _ai_generate_document_content(self, doc_type: DocumentType, 
                                      project_type: ProjectType,

    """Generate document content using AI based on project type and context"""
```

**Key Implementation Details**:
- AI-powered project type detection from overview content
- Dynamic document generation based on project type and complexity
- Removed hundreds of lines of redundant static templates
- Project-type-specific document creation (games skip API_SPEC.md, etc.)

**Template Selection Logic**:
- **Game Projects**: Skip API_SPEC.md, SECURITY.md, DATA_MODELS.md
- **Web Apps**: Include all templates
- **CLI Tools**: Skip API_SPEC.md, minimal SECURITY.md
- **API Services**: Focus on API_SPEC.md, comprehensive SECURITY.md

### 3. Incremental Work Order Creation âœ…

**Location**: `core/work_order_manager.py`

**Implemented Solution**:
```python
async def create_next_work_order(self, project_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Create single work order based on current project state using AI analysis"""
    
async def analyze_completion_and_plan_next(self, completed_work_order: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze completed work order and determine next steps using AI"""

async def initialize_project_for_incremental_execution(self, project_type: str, project_context: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Initialize project for incremental work order execution"""
```

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Replaced static WORK_ORDER_FLOWS with AI-driven analysis
- Incremental work order creation based on completion analysis
- AI determines optimal work order sequence based on project state
- Project-type-aware work order generation

**Project-Specific Work Order Flows**:
```python
WORK_ORDER_FLOWS = {
    ProjectType.GAME: [
        "Initialize Project Structure",
        "Create Game Loop",
        "Implement Core Mechanics",

        # Phase 1: Interactive Learning
        pm_result = await self.project_manager.execute(task)
        
        # Phase 2: Project Setup
        project_type = pm_result.output['project_type']
        project_context = pm_result.output['project_context']
        
        # Phase 3: Incremental Work Order Execution
        while True:
            work_order_id = await self.work_order_manager.create_next_work_order(
                await self.knowledge_base.get_project_context()
            )

            result = await self.work_order_manager.execute_work_order(work_order_id)
            await self.knowledge_base.update_from_completion(result)
        
        # Phase 4: Project Completion
        await self.finalize_project()

# CLI Integration - Simplified to 3 essential commands
