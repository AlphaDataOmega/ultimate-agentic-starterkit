# Pong Arcade Game

## Project Description
Pong is a classic arcade-style game that simulates table tennis, allowing two players or a player versus AI to control paddles and hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The main purpose is to create an engaging, educational project that demonstrates fundamental game development concepts like input handling, physics simulation, and rendering. This implementation focuses on simplicity and modularity, making it easy to extend with features like power-ups.

## Project Type
game (desktop-application)  # Not in list; closest to cli-tool but specialized

## Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Pygame
- **Database**: None
- **AI/ML Tools**: None

## Core Features & Requirements

### Feature 1: Paddle Controls
**Description**: Allow players to move paddles using keyboard inputs, with optional AI for single-player mode
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create paddle class with movement logic
- [ ] Implement keyboard event handling for controls
- [ ] Add AI opponent with basic tracking behavior

### Feature 2: Ball Physics  
**Description**: Simulate ball movement, collisions, and bouncing with increasing speed
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Setup ball class with velocity and position updates
- [ ] Handle collisions with paddles and walls
- [ ] Increase ball speed after each hit

### Feature 3: Scoring System
**Description**: Track points when the ball passes a paddle and end game at a winning score
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Display score on screen
- [ ] Detect scoring events and reset ball
- [ ] Show win screen and restart option

## File Structure
```

├── pong.py           # Main game script with loop, classes, and logic
├── requirements.txt  # Dependencies list (Pygame)
├── README.md         # Project documentation and instructions
└── assets/           # Optional folder for sounds/images if added
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] Application runs without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (minimum 80% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code follows best practices and style guidelines

## Quality Requirements
- **Minimum Confidence**: 0.8
- **Test Coverage**: 80%
- **Code Style**: PEP8 (Python)
- **Performance**: 60 FPS on standard hardware

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Installation commands
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configuration
# No .env needed; defaults work

# Run application
python pong.py
```

## Dependencies
- Pygame - Graphics, input, and sound handling

## Notes
- Special considerations: Pygame requires a display; test in windowed mode for debugging.
- Known limitations: No multiplayer over network; basic AI may be too easy/hard.
- Future enhancements: Add power-ups, customizable difficulty, high score saving.
